      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
          Food is almost synonymous with education. CampusFood is a company that delivers delicious
          campus cafeteria food to people across campuses in South Africa. More than that we are about
          the people. <br/> Our journey began as students at Mut who just were frustrated with physically 
          getting food from the cafeteria on campus with no other option.
